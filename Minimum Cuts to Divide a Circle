A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches two points on the edge of the circle and passes through its center, or
A cut that is represented by a straight line that touches one point on the edge of the circle and its center.
Given the integer n, return the minimum number of cuts needed to divide a circle into n equal slices.
Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The above figure shows how cutting the circle twice through the middle divides it into 4 equal slices.

Approach:-
1. If n==1 return 1.
2. If n is even then return n/2.
3. Else return n.

Solution in C++
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfCuts(int n) { 
        if(n==1)
        return 0;
        if(n%2==0)
        return n/2;
        else
        return n;
    }
};
