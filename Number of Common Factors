Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.
An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

Example 1:
Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Example 2:
Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.

Approach:-
1. Calculate maximum of a anb b into an integer variable named as n.
2. Run a for loop from i=1 to i<=n.
3. if(a%i==0 && b%i==0) then increment s.
4. Return s as an output.

Solution in C++
class Solution {
public:
    int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int s=0;
        int n;
        if(a>b)n=a;
        else
        n=b;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(a%i==0 && b%i==0)
            s++;
        }
        return s;
    }                                
};
