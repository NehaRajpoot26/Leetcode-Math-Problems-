You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

Example 1:
Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

Example 2:
Input: n = 7, k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.

Approach:-
1. Initialize integer vector array named as v.
2. Run a for loop from i=1 to i<=n.
3. if(n%i==0) then store ith iteration in v.
4. if(v.size()<k) then return -1.
5. Else return v[k-1].

Solution in C++
class Solution {
public:
    int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
      vector<int>v;
      for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)  
      {
          if(n%i==0)
          v.push_back(i);
      }
      if(v.size()<k)return -1;
      else
       return v[k-1];
    }
};
