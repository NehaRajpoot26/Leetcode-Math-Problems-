Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.

Example 1:
Input: n = 7
Output: 21
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 7] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7. The sum of these numbers is 21.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. The sum of these numbers is 40.

Approach:-
1. Initialize s=0 to calculate sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
2. Run a for loop from i=1 to i<=n.
3. if(i%3==0 || i%5==0 || i%7==0) then add i to s.
4. Return s as a result.

Solution in C++
class Solution {
public:
    int sumOfMultiples(int n) {
       int s=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(i%3==0 || i%5==0 || i%7==0)
            s=s+i;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
